## Introduction

### Why Pi?
Pi (π) is not just a mathematical constant; it represents infinite possibilities and the perfect circle of community-driven innovation. MemePi Token embodies these principles by creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where mathematics meets meme culture.

### Market Overview
The meme token market has evolved significantly, with successful projects demonstrating the power of community engagement. MemePi positions itself uniquely by combining mathematical principles with meme culture appeal.

### Problem Statement
Current meme tokens often lack substance beyond their initial hype. MemePi addresses this by incorporating mathematical principles into its tokenomics and governance structure.

## Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement
To become the leading mathematical meme token, bridging the gap between educational value and cryptocurrency innovation.

### Mission Statement
Empower users through a mathematically-sound tokenomics model while fostering a vibrant, educated community.

### Core Values
- Mathematical Integrity
- Community Empowerment
- Educational Focus
- Transparent Governance
- Sustainable Growth

## Technology

### Smart Contract Architecture
Built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, our smart contracts implement:
- ERC-20 standard compliance
- Automated burn mechanisms
- Anti-whale protection
- DAO governance capabilities

### Key Features
1. **Automated Burn Mechanism**
   - 2% of each transaction is automatically burned
   - Reduces total supply over time
   - Creates natural price appreciation potential

2. **Anti-Whale Protection**
   - Maximum transaction limits
   - Progressive selling fees
   - Holding time incentives

3. **DAO Governance**
   - Token-weighted voting
   - Proposal submission thresholds
   - Community-driven decision making

### Technical Specifications
- Token Standard: ERC-20
- Network: Ethereum
- Total Supply: 314,159,265,359 MEPI
- Decimal Places: 18
- Contract Verification: Etherscan verified

## Tokenomics

### Token Distribution
- 40% Public Sale
- 20% Liquidity Pool
- 15% Development
- 10% Marketing
- 10% Team (locked for 1 year)
- 5% Community Rewards

### Transaction Mechanics
Each transaction includes:
- 2% Burn Rate
- 1% Marketing Fee
- 1% Development Fund
- 1% Community Rewards

### Burn Mechanism
The automated burn mechanism follows a mathematical progression inspired by π:
- Initial burn rate: 2%
- Quarterly burn rate adjustment
- Target supply reduction aligned with π decimals

### Anti-Whale Protection
- Maximum wallet: 1% of total supply
- Maximum transaction: 0.1% of total supply
- Progressive selling fees based on holding time
